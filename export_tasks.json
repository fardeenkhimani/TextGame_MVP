        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA home office with  and 4 cleaning supply. \nA kitchen with  and 8 food item. \nA bedroom with  and 5 bed linen. \nA basement with 6 light bulb, 5 storage bin and 5 tools. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 cleaning supply, 0 light bulb, 0 storage bin, 0 tools, 0 food item, 0 bed linen. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: organize filing drawer\nTask: wash kitchen floors\nTask: fluff bed pillow\nTask: dust office shelves\nTask: change basement lightbulbs\nTask: organize storage bins\nTask: fix basement tools\nTask: prepare breakfast tray\nTask: arrange bed linen\nThe task change basement lightbulbs needs 6 light bulb \nThe task wash kitchen floors needs no resources. \nThe task organize filing drawer needs no resources. \nThe task fluff bed pillow needs no resources. \nThe task fix basement tools needs 5 tools \nThe task dust office shelves needs 4 cleaning supply \nThe task prepare breakfast tray needs 8 food item \nThe task arrange bed linen needs 5 bed linen \nThe task organize storage bins needs 5 storage bin \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA dining room with 10 dishware and 10 napkin. \nA laundry room with  and 7 hanger. \nA hallway with  and 4 cleaning supply. \nA kitchen with  and 6 spice. \nA bedroom with  and 5 bed linen. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 hanger, 0 cleaning supply, 0 spice, 0 bed linen, 0 dishware, 0 napkin. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: polish dinnerware\nTask: organize book collection\nTask: tidy laundry shelf\nTask: fold clean laundry\nTask: dust hallway fixtures\nTask: restock spices rack\nTask: arrange bed linens\nTask: set dinner table\nTask: set up dinner table\nThe task polish dinnerware needs no resources. \nThe task fold clean laundry needs 7 hanger \nThe task tidy laundry shelf needs no resources. \nThe task dust hallway fixtures needs 4 cleaning supply \nThe task set up dinner table needs 10 napkin \nThe task restock spices rack needs 6 spice \nThe task arrange bed linens needs 5 bed linen \nThe task set dinner table needs 10 dishware \nThe task organize book collection needs no resources. \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA home office with  and 5 office supply. \nA kitchen with 6 food item and 4 cleaning wipes. \nA laundry room with  and 4 lint roller. \nA living room with  and 4 cleaning supply. \nA hallway with  and 5 shoe polish. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 lint roller, 0 cleaning supply, 0 food item, 0 shoe polish, 0 office supply, 0 cleaning wipes. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: organize desk papers\nTask: brew herbal tea\nTask: clean computer screen\nTask: empty dryer lint\nTask: dust decorative items\nTask: prepare vegetable salad\nTask: polish hallway shoes\nTask: organize stationery supplies\nTask: deep clean oven\nThe task brew herbal tea needs no resources. \nThe task dust decorative items needs 4 cleaning supply \nThe task polish hallway shoes needs 5 shoe polish \nThe task organize stationery supplies needs 5 office supply \nThe task clean computer screen needs no resources. \nThe task organize desk papers needs no resources. \nThe task deep clean oven needs 4 cleaning wipes \nThe task prepare vegetable salad needs 6 food item \nThe task empty dryer lint needs 4 lint roller \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA laundry room with 5 laundry detergent, 4 lint roller and 5 laundry basket. \nA bedroom with  and 5 book. \nA bathroom with  and 6 cleaning product. \nA dining room with  and 6 tableware. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 cleaning product, 0 laundry detergent, 0 lint roller, 0 laundry basket, 0 book, 0 tableware. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: fold clean laundry\nTask: make the bed\nTask: brew fresh coffee\nTask: clean bathroom mirror\nTask: iron shirts\nTask: remove lint buildup\nTask: sort dirty laundry\nTask: arrange bedside books\nTask: set the dining table\nThe task clean bathroom mirror needs 6 cleaning product \nThe task remove lint buildup needs 4 lint roller \nThe task iron shirts needs 5 laundry detergent \nThe task fold clean laundry needs no resources. \nThe task set the dining table needs 6 tableware \nThe task make the bed needs no resources. \nThe task sort dirty laundry needs 5 laundry basket \nThe task arrange bedside books needs 5 book \nThe task brew fresh coffee needs no resources. \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA garage with 5 oil and 4 maintenance fluid. \nA basement with  and 5 storage bin. \nA hallway with 5 shoe polish and 5 cleaning supply. \nA living room with  and 5 light bulb. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 storage bin, 0 shoe polish, 0 light bulb, 0 oil, 0 cleaning supply, 0 maintenance fluid. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: organize tool chest\nTask: polish bathroom mirror\nTask: organize storage box\nTask: arrange storage shelves\nTask: polish hallway shoe\nTask: change light bulbs\nTask: change car oil\nTask: vacuum carpet area\nTask: inflate car tires\nThe task organize tool chest needs no resources. \nThe task vacuum carpet area needs 5 cleaning supply \nThe task change light bulbs needs 5 light bulb \nThe task polish bathroom mirror needs no resources. \nThe task arrange storage shelves needs 5 storage bin \nThe task organize storage box needs no resources. \nThe task inflate car tires needs 4 maintenance fluid \nThe task polish hallway shoe needs 5 shoe polish \nThe task change car oil needs 5 oil \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA dining room with  and 5 table decoration. \nA basement with 6 storage bin, 4 light bulb and 4 dehumidifier water. \nA laundry room with 4 laundry basket and 4 laundry detergent. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 storage bin, 0 laundry basket, 0 laundry detergent, 0 light bulb, 0 dehumidifier water, 0 table decoration. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: arrange dining table\nTask: vacuum the rug\nTask: polish silverware\nTask: organize storage bins\nTask: sort clean laundry\nTask: iron shirts\nTask: replace light bulb\nTask: dehumidify basement\nTask: decorate dining table\nThe task vacuum the rug needs no resources. \nThe task sort clean laundry needs 4 laundry basket \nThe task iron shirts needs 4 laundry detergent \nThe task dehumidify basement needs 4 dehumidifier water \nThe task decorate dining table needs 5 table decoration \nThe task replace light bulb needs 4 light bulb \nThe task polish silverware needs no resources. \nThe task arrange dining table needs no resources. \nThe task organize storage bins needs 6 storage bin \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA hallway with  and 4 light bulb. \nA bathroom with 5 soap and 4 cleaning product. \nA laundry room with 5 hanger and 5 laundry basket. \nA garage with  and 4 maintenance fluid. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 light bulb, 0 soap, 0 hanger, 0 cleaning product, 0 maintenance fluid, 0 laundry basket. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: organize book shelf\nTask: vacuum the carpet\nTask: set formal dinner\nTask: change hallway bulbs\nTask: fill hand soap dispenser\nTask: organize laundry supplies\nTask: clean bathroom mirrors\nTask: rotate car tires\nTask: sort laundry items\nThe task organize book shelf needs no resources. \nThe task clean bathroom mirrors needs 4 cleaning product \nThe task sort laundry items needs 5 laundry basket \nThe task rotate car tires needs 4 maintenance fluid \nThe task set formal dinner needs no resources. \nThe task fill hand soap dispenser needs 5 soap \nThe task vacuum the carpet needs no resources. \nThe task change hallway bulbs needs 4 light bulb \nThe task organize laundry supplies needs 5 hanger \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA basement with 4 storage bin and 5 safety supply. \nA garage with  and 5 cleaning supply. \nA living room with  and 5 light bulb. \nA kitchen with  and 6 spices. \nA bedroom with  and 4 bed linen. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 cleaning supply, 0 light bulb, 0 storage bin, 0 safety supply, 0 spices, 0 bed linen. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: organize storage shelf\nTask: polish desk surface\nTask: lubricate garage door\nTask: wash garage floor\nTask: replace light bulbs\nTask: organize storage bins\nTask: maintain the furnace\nTask: make rich curry\nTask: replace bed linens\nThe task maintain the furnace needs 5 safety supply \nThe task lubricate garage door needs no resources. \nThe task make rich curry needs 6 spices \nThe task organize storage shelf needs no resources. \nThe task wash garage floor needs 5 cleaning supply \nThe task replace bed linens needs 4 bed linen \nThe task polish desk surface needs no resources. \nThe task replace light bulbs needs 5 light bulb \nThe task organize storage bins needs 4 storage bin \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA kitchen with  and 4 food item. \nA basement with  and 5 storage bin. \nA dining room with  and 5 napkin. \nA bedroom with 7 laundry detergent and 4 scented candle. \nA home office with  and 5 cleaning supply. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 storage bin, 0 napkin, 0 laundry detergent, 0 cleaning supply, 0 food item, 0 scented candle. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: polish mirror\nTask: wash mixing bowl\nTask: brew fresh coffee\nTask: organize storage bins\nTask: set the table\nTask: organize wardrobe neatly\nTask: organize office files\nTask: prepare fruit salad\nTask: light scented candles\nThe task organize wardrobe neatly needs 7 laundry detergent \nThe task light scented candles needs 4 scented candle \nThe task wash mixing bowl needs no resources. \nThe task prepare fruit salad needs 4 food item \nThe task organize office files needs 5 cleaning supply \nThe task brew fresh coffee needs no resources. \nThe task set the table needs 5 napkin \nThe task organize storage bins needs 5 storage bin \nThe task polish mirror needs no resources. \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA kitchen with  and 5 baking supply. \nA garage with 4 cleaning supply and 5 maintenance fluid. \nA basement with 5 storage bin and 5 dehumidifier water. \nA home office with  and 4 trash bag. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 cleaning supply, 0 storage bin, 0 trash bag, 0 dehumidifier water, 0 baking supply, 0 maintenance fluid. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: wipe down counter\nTask: arrange dining chairs\nTask: polish bathroom mirror\nTask: organize tool collection\nTask: organize storage bins\nTask: organize desk items\nTask: test basement dehumidifier\nTask: prepare pancake batter\nTask: inflate vehicle tires\nThe task organize tool collection needs 4 cleaning supply \nThe task inflate vehicle tires needs 5 maintenance fluid \nThe task test basement dehumidifier needs 5 dehumidifier water \nThe task wipe down counter needs no resources. \nThe task polish bathroom mirror needs no resources. \nThe task arrange dining chairs needs no resources. \nThe task prepare pancake batter needs 5 baking supply \nThe task organize desk items needs 4 trash bag \nThe task organize storage bins needs 5 storage bin \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA living room with  and 5 light bulb. \nA kitchen with  and 5 coffee/tea. \nA dining room with  and 4 napkin. \nA basement with 10 storage bin and 5 safety supply. \nA bathroom with  and 5 cleaning product. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 napkin, 0 storage bin, 0 cleaning product, 0 coffee/tea, 0 light bulb, 0 safety supply. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: fluff sofa pillow\nTask: organize tool shelf\nTask: polish silverware set\nTask: lay dining table\nTask: reorganize storage shelves\nTask: sanitize bathroom surfaces\nTask: brew fresh coffee\nTask: replace dim light bulbs\nTask: inspect basement safety\nThe task reorganize storage shelves needs 10 storage bin \nThe task fluff sofa pillow needs no resources. \nThe task replace dim light bulbs needs 5 light bulb \nThe task lay dining table needs 4 napkin \nThe task polish silverware set needs no resources. \nThe task brew fresh coffee needs 5 coffee/tea \nThe task sanitize bathroom surfaces needs 5 cleaning product \nThe task organize tool shelf needs no resources. \nThe task inspect basement safety needs 5 safety supply \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA dining room with  and 10 dishware. \nA hallway with  and 5 light bulb. \nA kitchen with  and 5 cleaning wipe. \nA basement with  and 5 storage bin. \nA laundry room with 4 fabric softener and 4 laundry basket. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 light bulb, 0 cleaning wipe, 0 storage bin, 0 fabric softener, 0 laundry basket, 0 dishware. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: polish silverware set\nTask: organize shoe rack\nTask: fluff pillow\nTask: change hallway light\nTask: clean kitchen counter\nTask: organize storage bins\nTask: add fabric softener\nTask: sort clothes by color\nTask: set dining table\nThe task add fabric softener needs 4 fabric softener \nThe task organize shoe rack needs no resources. \nThe task clean kitchen counter needs 5 cleaning wipe \nThe task set dining table needs 10 dishware \nThe task fluff pillow needs no resources. \nThe task polish silverware set needs no resources. \nThe task sort clothes by color needs 4 laundry basket \nThe task change hallway light needs 5 light bulb \nThe task organize storage bins needs 5 storage bin \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA laundry room with  and 4 laundry basket. \nA hallway with  and 5 light bulb. \nA home office with  and 5 office supply. \nA kitchen with  and 6 cleaning wipe. \nA dining room with 6 utensil and 5 table decoration. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 laundry basket, 0 office supply, 0 cleaning wipe, 0 utensil, 0 table decoration, 0 light bulb. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: fold clean clothes\nTask: polish hallway mirror\nTask: tidy shoe rack\nTask: arrange laundry baskets\nTask: organize office supplies\nTask: wipe kitchen counters\nTask: set dining table\nTask: arrange table decor\nTask: replace hallway lightbulbs\nThe task fold clean clothes needs no resources. \nThe task polish hallway mirror needs no resources. \nThe task arrange laundry baskets needs 4 laundry basket \nThe task organize office supplies needs 5 office supply \nThe task replace hallway lightbulbs needs 5 light bulb \nThe task tidy shoe rack needs no resources. \nThe task wipe kitchen counters needs 6 cleaning wipe \nThe task arrange table decor needs 5 table decoration \nThe task set dining table needs 6 utensil \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA laundry room with  and 5 lint roller. \nA bathroom with  and 4 cleaning product. \nA bedroom with  and 5 laundry detergent. \nA living room with  and 4 light bulb. \nA basement with  and 6 storage bin. \nA garage with  and 5 lubricant. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 cleaning product, 0 laundry detergent, 0 light bulb, 0 storage bin, 0 lubricant, 0 lint roller. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: vacuum floor thoroughly\nTask: wipe countertop clean\nTask: fold towel neatly\nTask: sanitize shower walls\nTask: organize bedroom closet\nTask: replace light bulbs\nTask: organize storage bins\nTask: lubricate garage door\nTask: empty lint trap\nThe task empty lint trap needs 5 lint roller \nThe task lubricate garage door needs 5 lubricant \nThe task organize bedroom closet needs 5 laundry detergent \nThe task vacuum floor thoroughly needs no resources. \nThe task fold towel neatly needs no resources. \nThe task wipe countertop clean needs no resources. \nThe task sanitize shower walls needs 4 cleaning product \nThe task replace light bulbs needs 4 light bulb \nThe task organize storage bins needs 6 storage bin \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA living room with 4 throw blanket and 5 candle. \nA bedroom with  and 5 bed linen. \nA garage with 5 cleaning supply and 6 spare part. \nA basement with  and 4 storage bin. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 throw blanket, 0 cleaning supply, 0 bed linen, 0 candle, 0 storage bin, 0 spare part. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: arrange book shelf\nTask: change bed linen\nTask: polish hall mirror\nTask: organize throw blankets\nTask: reorganize storage shelves\nTask: organize nightstand drawer\nTask: light scented candles\nTask: organize tool rack\nTask: repair garage shelves\nThe task change bed linen needs no resources. \nThe task repair garage shelves needs 6 spare part \nThe task reorganize storage shelves needs 5 cleaning supply \nThe task arrange book shelf needs no resources. \nThe task organize nightstand drawer needs 5 bed linen \nThe task organize tool rack needs 4 storage bin \nThe task light scented candles needs 5 candle \nThe task polish hall mirror needs no resources. \nThe task organize throw blankets needs 4 throw blanket \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA hallway with  and 5 light bulb. \nA garage with 5 cleaning supply and 10 paint. \nA kitchen with  and 8 food item. \nA basement with  and 5 storage bin. \nA bathroom with  and 6 towel. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 cleaning supply, 0 light bulb, 0 food item, 0 storage bin, 0 paint, 0 towel. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: change bed linen\nTask: polish wood fixture\nTask: organize shoe rack\nTask: wash car windows\nTask: change hallway bulbs\nTask: cook omelette breakfast\nTask: organize storage bins\nTask: paint tool rack\nTask: stock up towels\nThe task change bed linen needs no resources. \nThe task paint tool rack needs 10 paint \nThe task organize shoe rack needs no resources. \nThe task polish wood fixture needs no resources. \nThe task cook omelette breakfast needs 8 food item \nThe task wash car windows needs 5 cleaning supply \nThe task stock up towels needs 6 towel \nThe task change hallway bulbs needs 5 light bulb \nThe task organize storage bins needs 5 storage bin \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA bedroom with  and 4 cleaning supply. \nA basement with  and 6 storage bin. \nA living room with 5 light bulb and 5 throw blanket. \nA laundry room with 5 laundry basket and 5 fabric softener. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 storage bin, 0 light bulb, 0 laundry basket, 0 throw blanket, 0 fabric softener, 0 cleaning supply. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: polish wood rail\nTask: organize tool rack\nTask: fold clean linen\nTask: organize storage bins\nTask: replace burnt-out bulbs\nTask: fold laundry clothes\nTask: arrange throw pillows\nTask: restore laundry freshness\nTask: dust all surfaces\nThe task replace burnt-out bulbs needs 5 light bulb \nThe task polish wood rail needs no resources. \nThe task organize tool rack needs no resources. \nThe task fold clean linen needs no resources. \nThe task arrange throw pillows needs 5 throw blanket \nThe task restore laundry freshness needs 5 fabric softener \nThe task dust all surfaces needs 4 cleaning supply \nThe task fold laundry clothes needs 5 laundry basket \nThe task organize storage bins needs 6 storage bin \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA home office with 10 notebook and 5 paper. \nA laundry room with 4 laundry basket and 4 laundry detergent. \nA living room with  and 6 light bulb. \nA bedroom with  and 5 bed linen. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 notebook, 0 laundry basket, 0 light bulb, 0 bed linen, 0 paper, 0 laundry detergent. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: arrange table setting\nTask: polish silverware\nTask: wipe dining chair\nTask: organize office supplies\nTask: fold clean laundry\nTask: replace light bulbs\nTask: change bed linens\nTask: sort office papers\nTask: sort laundry items\nThe task wipe dining chair needs no resources. \nThe task organize office supplies needs 10 notebook \nThe task fold clean laundry needs 4 laundry basket \nThe task sort office papers needs 5 paper \nThe task sort laundry items needs 4 laundry detergent \nThe task change bed linens needs 5 bed linen \nThe task arrange table setting needs no resources. \nThe task polish silverware needs no resources. \nThe task replace light bulbs needs 6 light bulb \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA laundry room with  and 5 laundry basket. \nA hallway with  and 4 cleaning supply. \nA living room with 5 decorative item and 4 air freshener. \nA basement with  and 6 storage bin. \nA bedroom with  and 5 bed linen. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 cleaning supply, 0 decorative item, 0 laundry basket, 0 storage bin, 0 bed linen, 0 air freshener. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: organize document files\nTask: polish silverware\nTask: fold clean clothes\nTask: clean hallway floor\nTask: arrange coffee table\nTask: organize laundry items\nTask: install storage bins\nTask: replace bed linens\nTask: restock air fresheners\nThe task organize laundry items needs 5 laundry basket \nThe task restock air fresheners needs 4 air freshener \nThe task clean hallway floor needs 4 cleaning supply \nThe task fold clean clothes needs no resources. \nThe task organize document files needs no resources. \nThe task polish silverware needs no resources. \nThe task arrange coffee table needs 5 decorative item \nThe task replace bed linens needs 5 bed linen \nThe task install storage bins needs 6 storage bin \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA bedroom with  and 4 pillow. \nA home office with 7 office supply and 5 paper. \nA laundry room with  and 5 laundry detergent. \nA basement with  and 5 tool. \nA living room with  and 5 candle. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 office supply, 0 laundry detergent, 0 pillow, 0 paper, 0 tool, 0 candle. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: organize bookshelf\nTask: update wall calendar\nTask: set dinner table\nTask: organize desk supplies\nTask: fold clean laundry\nTask: arrange pillows neatly\nTask: restock paper in printer\nTask: install storage shelves\nTask: light scented candles\nThe task arrange pillows neatly needs 4 pillow \nThe task organize desk supplies needs 7 office supply \nThe task fold clean laundry needs 5 laundry detergent \nThe task restock paper in printer needs 5 paper \nThe task install storage shelves needs 5 tool \nThe task light scented candles needs 5 candle \nThe task update wall calendar needs no resources. \nThe task organize bookshelf needs no resources. \nThe task set dinner table needs no resources. \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA hallway with  and 4 cleaning supply. \nA kitchen with 6 food item and 6 paper towel. \nA home office with  and 4 office supply. \nA garage with  and 5 cleaning wipes. \nA bedroom with  and 6 pillow. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 cleaning supply, 0 food item, 0 office supply, 0 paper towel, 0 cleaning wipes, 0 pillow. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: fold clean towel\nTask: organize storage box\nTask: scrub shower tile\nTask: polish hallway floor\nTask: prepare fresh juice\nTask: organize office supplies\nTask: replace kitchen towels\nTask: wash garage windows\nTask: arrange bed pillows\nThe task organize storage box needs no resources. \nThe task polish hallway floor needs 4 cleaning supply \nThe task organize office supplies needs 4 office supply \nThe task arrange bed pillows needs 6 pillow \nThe task scrub shower tile needs no resources. \nThe task prepare fresh juice needs 6 food item \nThe task replace kitchen towels needs 6 paper towel \nThe task wash garage windows needs 5 cleaning wipes \nThe task fold clean towel needs no resources. \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA kitchen with 4 coffee/tea and 10 baking supply. \nA laundry room with  and 5 laundry basket. \nA bathroom with  and 7 towel. \nA basement with  and 4 light bulb. \nA garage with  and 5 cleaning supply. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 towel, 0 light bulb, 0 laundry basket, 0 cleaning supply, 0 coffee/tea, 0 baking supply. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: wipe kitchen counter\nTask: sort clean laundry\nTask: organize filing cabinet\nTask: stock fresh towels\nTask: replace basement bulbs\nTask: sort family laundry\nTask: organize garden tools\nTask: brew fresh coffee\nTask: bake a cake\nThe task organize filing cabinet needs no resources. \nThe task organize garden tools needs 5 cleaning supply \nThe task sort clean laundry needs no resources. \nThe task wipe kitchen counter needs no resources. \nThe task bake a cake needs 10 baking supply \nThe task brew fresh coffee needs 4 coffee/tea \nThe task sort family laundry needs 5 laundry basket \nThe task stock fresh towels needs 7 towel \nThe task replace basement bulbs needs 4 light bulb \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA kitchen with  and 4 cleaning wipes. \nA garage with 4 spare part, 5 cleaning supply and 5 paint. \nA basement with  and 5 storage bin. \nA hallway with  and 5 shoe polish. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 spare part, 0 storage bin, 0 shoe polish, 0 cleaning supply, 0 paint, 0 cleaning wipes. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: sort desk papers\nTask: vacuum carpet thoroughly\nTask: brew fresh coffee\nTask: install new shelf\nTask: organize storage bins\nTask: polish hallway shoes\nTask: organize storage shelves\nTask: organize garage shelves\nTask: wipe down appliances\nThe task wipe down appliances needs 4 cleaning wipes \nThe task vacuum carpet thoroughly needs no resources. \nThe task organize storage shelves needs 5 cleaning supply \nThe task install new shelf needs 4 spare part \nThe task polish hallway shoes needs 5 shoe polish \nThe task sort desk papers needs no resources. \nThe task organize garage shelves needs 5 paint \nThe task brew fresh coffee needs no resources. \nThe task organize storage bins needs 5 storage bin \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA kitchen with  and 5 coffee/tea. \nA hallway with 5 shoe polish and 5 light bulb. \nA bedroom with  and 4 bed linen. \nA bathroom with 4 cleaning product and 6 toilet paper. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 bed linen, 0 cleaning product, 0 coffee/tea, 0 shoe polish, 0 light bulb, 0 toilet paper. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: wash kitchen floor\nTask: polish wooden rail\nTask: arrange cutlery neatly\nTask: replace bed linens\nTask: clean bathroom mirrors\nTask: grind coffee beans\nTask: polish hallway rail\nTask: replace hallway bulb\nTask: restock toilet paper\nThe task arrange cutlery neatly needs no resources. \nThe task polish wooden rail needs no resources. \nThe task wash kitchen floor needs no resources. \nThe task grind coffee beans needs 5 coffee/tea \nThe task replace hallway bulb needs 5 light bulb \nThe task clean bathroom mirrors needs 4 cleaning product \nThe task polish hallway rail needs 5 shoe polish \nThe task restock toilet paper needs 6 toilet paper \nThe task replace bed linens needs 4 bed linen \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA dining room with  and 5 dishware. \nA bathroom with 4 towel and 5 air freshener. \nA living room with  and 4 throw blanket. \nA basement with  and 6 storage bin. \nA garage with  and 4 cleaning supply. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 dishware, 0 throw blanket, 0 storage bin, 0 cleaning supply, 0 towel, 0 air freshener. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: polish dining table\nTask: organize bathroom shelf\nTask: vacuum living rug\nTask: set dining table\nTask: replace couch pillows\nTask: organize storage bins\nTask: organize tool bench\nTask: stock spare towels\nTask: add air freshener\nThe task add air freshener needs 5 air freshener \nThe task organize bathroom shelf needs no resources. \nThe task stock spare towels needs 4 towel \nThe task polish dining table needs no resources. \nThe task vacuum living rug needs no resources. \nThe task organize storage bins needs 6 storage bin \nThe task replace couch pillows needs 4 throw blanket \nThe task organize tool bench needs 4 cleaning supply \nThe task set dining table needs 5 dishware \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA dining room with 6 napkin and 4 cleaning supply. \nA kitchen with  and 5 cleaning wipe. \nA home office with  and 5 printer ink. \nA laundry room with 5 laundry basket and 10 hangers. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 cleaning wipe, 0 napkin, 0 printer ink, 0 laundry basket, 0 cleaning supply, 0 hangers. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: arrange dining table\nTask: organize tool cabinet\nTask: tidy up bed\nTask: polish countertops\nTask: set dining table\nTask: replace printer ink\nTask: sort light laundry\nTask: polish dining table\nTask: organize laundry shelves\nThe task replace printer ink needs 5 printer ink \nThe task polish dining table needs 4 cleaning supply \nThe task tidy up bed needs no resources. \nThe task organize laundry shelves needs 10 hangers \nThe task organize tool cabinet needs no resources. \nThe task arrange dining table needs no resources. \nThe task sort light laundry needs 5 laundry basket \nThe task polish countertops needs 5 cleaning wipe \nThe task set dining table needs 6 napkin \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA bathroom with  and 5 air freshener. \nA laundry room with  and 5 laundry basket. \nA living room with  and 5 throw blanket. \nA dining room with 6 table decoration and 4 cleaning supply. \nA home office with  and 4 notebook. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 laundry basket, 0 throw blanket, 0 table decoration, 0 cleaning supply, 0 notebook, 0 air freshener. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: organize tool shelf\nTask: clean bathroom mirror\nTask: wipe kitchen countertop\nTask: fold washed clothes\nTask: arrange sofa cushions\nTask: set dining table\nTask: polish dining table\nTask: take meeting notes\nTask: replace air freshener\nThe task wipe kitchen countertop needs no resources. \nThe task take meeting notes needs 4 notebook \nThe task clean bathroom mirror needs no resources. \nThe task polish dining table needs 4 cleaning supply \nThe task fold washed clothes needs 5 laundry basket \nThe task replace air freshener needs 5 air freshener \nThe task arrange sofa cushions needs 5 throw blanket \nThe task organize tool shelf needs no resources. \nThe task set dining table needs 6 table decoration \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA laundry room with  and 5 air freshener. \nA bathroom with  and 6 cleaning product. \nA dining room with  and 6 napkin. \nA home office with  and 5 office supply. \nA living room with  and 5 decorative items. \nA basement with  and 5 light bulb. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 cleaning product, 0 napkin, 0 air freshener, 0 office supply, 0 decorative items, 0 light bulb. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: sort colored laundry\nTask: fluff pillow\nTask: fold clean clothes\nTask: unclog bathroom drain\nTask: set the table\nTask: freshen laundry room\nTask: organize office supplies\nTask: arrange photo frames\nTask: replace basement light\nThe task sort colored laundry needs no resources. \nThe task fold clean clothes needs no resources. \nThe task organize office supplies needs 5 office supply \nThe task fluff pillow needs no resources. \nThe task replace basement light needs 5 light bulb \nThe task freshen laundry room needs 5 air freshener \nThe task set the table needs 6 napkin \nThe task unclog bathroom drain needs 6 cleaning product \nThe task arrange photo frames needs 5 decorative items \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA dining room with  and 4 cleaning supply. \nA living room with  and 5 candle. \nA laundry room with  and 5 laundry basket. \nA basement with 4 light bulb and 5 storage bin. \nA bathroom with  and 4 towel. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 candle, 0 cleaning supply, 0 laundry basket, 0 light bulb, 0 towel, 0 storage bin. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: polish silverware stand\nTask: set dining table\nTask: arrange spice rack\nTask: light scented candles\nTask: polish silverware set\nTask: organize laundry supplies\nTask: install new light bulbs\nTask: arrange bathroom towels\nTask: organize storage bins\nThe task organize laundry supplies needs 5 laundry basket \nThe task arrange bathroom towels needs 4 towel \nThe task install new light bulbs needs 4 light bulb \nThe task organize storage bins needs 5 storage bin \nThe task light scented candles needs 5 candle \nThe task polish silverware set needs 4 cleaning supply \nThe task arrange spice rack needs no resources. \nThe task set dining table needs no resources. \nThe task polish silverware stand needs no resources. \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA laundry room with 7 laundry basket and 4 hangers. \nA bedroom with  and 4 bed linen. \nA bathroom with  and 10 towel. \nA dining room with  and 6 napkin. \nA garage with  and 6 cleaning supply. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 laundry basket, 0 bed linen, 0 hangers, 0 towel, 0 napkin, 0 cleaning supply. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: arrange couch pillow\nTask: organize book shelf\nTask: polish mirror\nTask: organize laundry baskets\nTask: replace worn linens\nTask: fold clean laundry\nTask: organize bathroom towels\nTask: set dining table\nTask: organize tool shelf\nThe task organize book shelf needs no resources. \nThe task replace worn linens needs 4 bed linen \nThe task fold clean laundry needs 4 hangers \nThe task arrange couch pillow needs no resources. \nThe task organize laundry baskets needs 7 laundry basket \nThe task organize bathroom towels needs 10 towel \nThe task organize tool shelf needs 6 cleaning supply \nThe task set dining table needs 6 napkin \nThe task polish mirror needs no resources. \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA laundry room with  and 5 laundry basket. \nA bathroom with  and 4 cleaning product. \nA kitchen with 6 baking supply and 5 cleaning wipes. \nA dining room with  and 6 dishware. \nA basement with  and 5 storage bin. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 cleaning product, 0 baking supply, 0 cleaning wipes, 0 dishware, 0 storage bin, 0 laundry basket. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: organize bedside drawer\nTask: buff floor mirror\nTask: sort laundry items\nTask: clean bathroom mirror\nTask: bake muffins\nTask: clean countertop surface\nTask: set dining table\nTask: organize storage shelves\nTask: organize laundry basket\nThe task clean bathroom mirror needs 4 cleaning product \nThe task organize storage shelves needs 5 storage bin \nThe task buff floor mirror needs no resources. \nThe task sort laundry items needs no resources. \nThe task organize bedside drawer needs no resources. \nThe task clean countertop surface needs 5 cleaning wipes \nThe task bake muffins needs 6 baking supply \nThe task organize laundry basket needs 5 laundry basket \nThe task set dining table needs 6 dishware \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA hallway with  and 6 cleaning supply. \nA living room with 5 candle, 4 light bulb and 5 air freshener. \nA laundry room with 4 laundry basket and 4 lint roller. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 candle, 0 cleaning supply, 0 light bulb, 0 laundry basket, 0 air freshener, 0 lint roller. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: repair garden tool\nTask: polish mirror frame\nTask: polish kitchen faucet\nTask: light five candles\nTask: polish welcome mat\nTask: replace burned light bulbs\nTask: fold clean laundry\nTask: refresh air fresheners\nTask: organize lint rollers\nThe task repair garden tool needs no resources. \nThe task organize lint rollers needs 4 lint roller \nThe task refresh air fresheners needs 5 air freshener \nThe task fold clean laundry needs 4 laundry basket \nThe task polish kitchen faucet needs no resources. \nThe task polish welcome mat needs 6 cleaning supply \nThe task light five candles needs 5 candle \nThe task polish mirror frame needs no resources. \nThe task replace burned light bulbs needs 4 light bulb \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA laundry room with  and 5 laundry detergent. \nA garage with  and 4 maintenance fluid. \nA home office with  and 5 cleaning supply. \nA kitchen with  and 8 cleaning wipes. \nA bathroom with  and 5 towel. \nA bedroom with  and 5 bed linen. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 maintenance fluid, 0 laundry detergent, 0 cleaning supply, 0 cleaning wipes, 0 towel, 0 bed linen. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: fold dry laundry\nTask: organize storage shelf\nTask: arrange floral decor\nTask: inflate car tyres\nTask: wash delicates clothes\nTask: clean computer monitor\nTask: deep clean oven\nTask: replace shower curtains\nTask: replace bed linens\nThe task inflate car tyres needs 4 maintenance fluid \nThe task wash delicates clothes needs 5 laundry detergent \nThe task clean computer monitor needs 5 cleaning supply \nThe task organize storage shelf needs no resources. \nThe task replace shower curtains needs 5 towel \nThe task replace bed linens needs 5 bed linen \nThe task arrange floral decor needs no resources. \nThe task deep clean oven needs 8 cleaning wipes \nThe task fold dry laundry needs no resources. \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA living room with 4 light bulb and 5 throw blanket. \nA garage with 5 cleaning supply and 5 lubricant. \nA bathroom with  and 5 soap. \nA basement with  and 5 storage bin. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 cleaning supply, 0 lubricant, 0 soap, 0 light bulb, 0 throw blanket, 0 storage bin. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: vacuum carpet thoroughly\nTask: sort color laundry\nTask: organize tool shelf\nTask: organize storage bins\nTask: lubricate door hinges\nTask: polish bathroom mirror\nTask: change light bulbs\nTask: arrange throw blankets\nTask: organize basement shelves\nThe task vacuum carpet thoroughly needs no resources. \nThe task change light bulbs needs 4 light bulb \nThe task polish bathroom mirror needs 5 soap \nThe task sort color laundry needs no resources. \nThe task arrange throw blankets needs 5 throw blanket \nThe task lubricate door hinges needs 5 lubricant \nThe task organize basement shelves needs 5 storage bin \nThe task organize tool shelf needs no resources. \nThe task organize storage bins needs 5 cleaning supply \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA living room with  and 4 throw blanket. \nA garage with  and 5 maintenance fluid. \nA laundry room with  and 10 hanger. \nA bathroom with 5 cleaning product and 6 towel. \nA bedroom with  and 4 bed linen. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 throw blanket, 0 maintenance fluid, 0 hanger, 0 cleaning product, 0 towel, 0 bed linen. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: vacuum hallway floor\nTask: polish silverware\nTask: arrange fresh flower\nTask: replace throw pillows\nTask: organize tool shelf\nTask: organize laundry supplies\nTask: clean bathroom mirror\nTask: arrange bathroom towels\nTask: change bed linens\nThe task clean bathroom mirror needs 5 cleaning product \nThe task vacuum hallway floor needs no resources. \nThe task arrange bathroom towels needs 6 towel \nThe task arrange fresh flower needs no resources. \nThe task change bed linens needs 4 bed linen \nThe task polish silverware needs no resources. \nThe task organize tool shelf needs 5 maintenance fluid \nThe task replace throw pillows needs 4 throw blanket \nThe task organize laundry supplies needs 10 hanger \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA kitchen with  and 5 cleaning wipe. \nA home office with 5 office supply and 5 paper. \nA bedroom with  and 5 bed linen. \nA living room with 4 light bulb and 4 decorative item. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 cleaning wipe, 0 office supply, 0 paper, 0 bed linen, 0 light bulb, 0 decorative item. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: wash dinner dish\nTask: sort clean cloth\nTask: organize tool shelf\nTask: mop kitchen floor\nTask: stock office supplies\nTask: organize file cabinet\nTask: change bed linens\nTask: replace light bulbs\nTask: arrange decorative items\nThe task change bed linens needs 5 bed linen \nThe task stock office supplies needs 5 office supply \nThe task organize file cabinet needs 5 paper \nThe task sort clean cloth needs no resources. \nThe task arrange decorative items needs 4 decorative item \nThe task mop kitchen floor needs 5 cleaning wipe \nThe task organize tool shelf needs no resources. \nThe task replace light bulbs needs 4 light bulb \nThe task wash dinner dish needs no resources. \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA living room with  and 4 light bulb. \nA basement with  and 4 storage bin. \nA home office with  and 6 office supply. \nA garage with  and 5 cleaning supply. \nA bathroom with  and 8 towel. \nA laundry room with  and 5 laundry basket. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 office supply, 0 cleaning supply, 0 towel, 0 light bulb, 0 storage bin, 0 laundry basket. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: rearrange book shelf\nTask: vacuum carpet thoroughly\nTask: organize storage space\nTask: organize desk supplies\nTask: organize tool shelves\nTask: replace bathroom towels\nTask: replace light bulbs\nTask: organize seasonal decorations\nTask: organize laundry basket\nThe task rearrange book shelf needs no resources. \nThe task organize tool shelves needs 5 cleaning supply \nThe task vacuum carpet thoroughly needs no resources. \nThe task replace bathroom towels needs 8 towel \nThe task organize desk supplies needs 6 office supply \nThe task organize seasonal decorations needs 4 storage bin \nThe task organize storage space needs no resources. \nThe task replace light bulbs needs 4 light bulb \nThe task organize laundry basket needs 5 laundry basket \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items.

For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA bathroom with 8 toilet paper, 5 cleaning product, 4 trash bag and 4 towel. \nA dining room with  and 6 napkin. \nA bedroom with  and 4 bed linens. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 toilet paper, 0 cleaning product, 0 napkin, 0 trash bag, 0 towel, 0 bed linens. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: organize spice rack\nTask: vacuum the carpet\nTask: polish the mirror\nTask: restock toilet paper\nTask: clean bathroom mirrors\nTask: set dining table\nTask: replenish trash bags\nTask: change bath towels\nTask: change bed linens\nThe task polish the mirror needs no resources. \nThe task change bath towels needs 4 towel \nThe task clean bathroom mirrors needs 5 cleaning product \nThe task restock toilet paper needs 8 toilet paper \nThe task organize spice rack needs no resources. \nThe task change bed linens needs 4 bed linens \nThe task replenish trash bags needs 4 trash bag \nThe task vacuum the carpet needs no resources. \nThe task set dining table needs 6 napkin \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA kitchen with 4 food item and 10 cleaning wipe. \nA hallway with  and 6 cleaning supply. \nA bathroom with  and 5 towel. \nA garage with 4 maintenance fluid and 4 trash bag. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 food item, 0 cleaning supply, 0 towel, 0 maintenance fluid, 0 cleaning wipe, 0 trash bag. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: polish silverware collection\nTask: organize book shelf\nTask: straighten couch cushions\nTask: prepare veggie platters\nTask: polish hallway floor\nTask: organize bathroom towels\nTask: organize tool rack\nTask: sanitize kitchen surface\nTask: sort garage tools\nThe task polish silverware collection needs no resources. \nThe task organize book shelf needs no resources. \nThe task prepare veggie platters needs 4 food item \nThe task polish hallway floor needs 6 cleaning supply \nThe task organize tool rack needs 4 maintenance fluid \nThe task sanitize kitchen surface needs 10 cleaning wipe \nThe task organize bathroom towels needs 5 towel \nThe task straighten couch cushions needs no resources. \nThe task sort garage tools needs 4 trash bag \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA hallway with  and 5 shoe polish. \nA dining room with 6 tableware, 4 table decoration and 6 utensil. \nA basement with  and 5 storage bin. \nA home office with  and 5 office supply. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 shoe polish, 0 tableware, 0 table decoration, 0 storage bin, 0 office supply, 0 utensil. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: organize tool shelf\nTask: tuck bed sheet\nTask: clean bathroom mirror\nTask: polish hallway floor\nTask: arrange dining table\nTask: decorate dining table\nTask: organize storage bins\nTask: organize office desk\nTask: set dining table\nThe task clean bathroom mirror needs no resources. \nThe task polish hallway floor needs 5 shoe polish \nThe task decorate dining table needs 4 table decoration \nThe task organize office desk needs 5 office supply \nThe task set dining table needs 6 utensil \nThe task tuck bed sheet needs no resources. \nThe task arrange dining table needs 6 tableware \nThe task organize tool shelf needs no resources. \nThe task organize storage bins needs 5 storage bin \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA dining room with  and 8 dishware. \nA kitchen with  and 6 cleaning wipe. \nA garage with  and 4 cleaning supply. \nA hallway with  and 4 light bulb. \nA home office with 5 office supply and 4 sticky note. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 cleaning wipe, 0 dishware, 0 cleaning supply, 0 light bulb, 0 office supply, 0 sticky note. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: arrange dining centerpiece\nTask: polish kitchen counter\nTask: vacuum living carpet\nTask: wash kitchen windows\nTask: set dining table\nTask: organize tool shelves\nTask: replace hallway bulbs\nTask: organize desk supplies\nTask: organize bookshelf\nThe task organize tool shelves needs 4 cleaning supply \nThe task wash kitchen windows needs 6 cleaning wipe \nThe task polish kitchen counter needs no resources. \nThe task organize desk supplies needs 5 office supply \nThe task arrange dining centerpiece needs no resources. \nThe task organize bookshelf needs 4 sticky note \nThe task vacuum living carpet needs no resources. \nThe task replace hallway bulbs needs 4 light bulb \nThe task set dining table needs 8 dishware \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA living room with 4 light bulb and 5 candle. \nA home office with  and 5 office supply. \nA basement with  and 6 storage bin. \nA kitchen with  and 4 coffee/tea. \nA dining room with  and 6 dishware. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 office supply, 0 light bulb, 0 storage bin, 0 candle, 0 coffee/tea, 0 dishware. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: arrange bookshelf neatly\nTask: vacuum hallway floor\nTask: organize desk items\nTask: organize office supplies\nTask: replace burnt light bulbs\nTask: organize storage bins\nTask: light 5 candles\nTask: brew morning coffee\nTask: set dinner table\nThe task set dinner table needs 6 dishware \nThe task vacuum hallway floor needs no resources. \nThe task arrange bookshelf neatly needs no resources. \nThe task light 5 candles needs 5 candle \nThe task organize office supplies needs 5 office supply \nThe task organize storage bins needs 6 storage bin \nThe task replace burnt light bulbs needs 4 light bulb \nThe task brew morning coffee needs 4 coffee/tea \nThe task organize desk items needs no resources. \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA living room with  and 4 decorative item. \nA basement with  and 5 storage bin. \nA dining room with  and 6 table decoration. \nA garage with  and 5 oil. \nA laundry room with  and 4 laundry basket. \nA kitchen with  and 5 cleaning wipe. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 table decoration, 0 decorative item, 0 oil, 0 storage bin, 0 laundry basket, 0 cleaning wipe. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: arrange book shelf\nTask: polish wooden furniture\nTask: organize holiday decor\nTask: decorate dining table\nTask: add accent pillows\nTask: change oil filter\nTask: organize storage items\nTask: sort clean laundry\nTask: clean kitchen counters\nThe task clean kitchen counters needs 5 cleaning wipe \nThe task arrange book shelf needs no resources. \nThe task organize storage items needs 5 storage bin \nThe task sort clean laundry needs 4 laundry basket \nThe task change oil filter needs 5 oil \nThe task polish wooden furniture needs no resources. \nThe task add accent pillows needs 4 decorative item \nThe task decorate dining table needs 6 table decoration \nThe task organize holiday decor needs no resources. \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA hallway with  and 5 welcome mat. \nA kitchen with  and 4 coffee/tea. \nA bathroom with  and 4 cleaning product. \nA laundry room with  and 5 laundry basket. \nA home office with  and 10 office supply. \nA dining room with  and 4 napkin. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 coffee/tea, 0 cleaning product, 0 welcome mat, 0 laundry basket, 0 office supply, 0 napkin. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: vacuum hallway rug\nTask: polish hallway mirror\nTask: arrange shoe rack\nTask: brew morning coffee\nTask: scrub bathroom sink\nTask: place welcome mats\nTask: sort dirty laundry\nTask: organize office supplies\nTask: set dining table\nThe task polish hallway mirror needs no resources. \nThe task vacuum hallway rug needs no resources. \nThe task organize office supplies needs 10 office supply \nThe task sort dirty laundry needs 5 laundry basket \nThe task scrub bathroom sink needs 4 cleaning product \nThe task arrange shoe rack needs no resources. \nThe task brew morning coffee needs 4 coffee/tea \nThe task place welcome mats needs 5 welcome mat \nThe task set dining table needs 4 napkin \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA home office with  and 4 cleaning supply. \nA dining room with  and 10 utensil. \nA bedroom with 5 bed linen and 5 scented candle. \nA living room with  and 5 decorative item. \nA laundry room with  and 4 laundry basket. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 utensil, 0 bed linen, 0 decorative item, 0 scented candle, 0 laundry basket, 0 cleaning supply. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: organize file cabinet\nTask: vacuum hallway rug\nTask: polish silverware\nTask: set dining table\nTask: replace bed linens\nTask: arrange decorative items\nTask: light scented candles\nTask: sort clean laundry\nTask: clean computer monitor\nThe task vacuum hallway rug needs no resources. \nThe task sort clean laundry needs 4 laundry basket \nThe task clean computer monitor needs 4 cleaning supply \nThe task light scented candles needs 5 scented candle \nThe task polish silverware needs no resources. \nThe task organize file cabinet needs no resources. \nThe task replace bed linens needs 5 bed linen \nThe task arrange decorative items needs 5 decorative item \nThe task set dining table needs 10 utensil \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA kitchen with 4 food item and 4 tea. \nA living room with  and 4 cleaning supply. \nA laundry room with  and 5 laundry detergent. \nA hallway with  and 4 light bulb. \nA bathroom with  and 4 towel. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 cleaning supply, 0 food item, 0 tea, 0 laundry detergent, 0 light bulb, 0 towel. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: organize storage area\nTask: polish wine rack\nTask: wash fruit bowl\nTask: refresh sofa cushions\nTask: restock pantry items\nTask: make herbal tea\nTask: fold clean laundry\nTask: replace hallway bulbs\nTask: refresh bathroom towels\nThe task refresh sofa cushions needs 4 cleaning supply \nThe task refresh bathroom towels needs 4 towel \nThe task organize storage area needs no resources. \nThe task fold clean laundry needs 5 laundry detergent \nThe task wash fruit bowl needs no resources. \nThe task make herbal tea needs 4 tea \nThe task polish wine rack needs no resources. \nThe task replace hallway bulbs needs 4 light bulb \nThe task restock pantry items needs 4 food item \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA bathroom with 4 cleaning product and 4 air freshener. \nA hallway with 4 shoe polish, 5 light bulb and 5 coat hanger. \nA garage with  and 5 trash bag. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 cleaning product, 0 air freshener, 0 shoe polish, 0 trash bag, 0 light bulb, 0 coat hanger. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: arrange throw pillow\nTask: slice fresh vegetable\nTask: polish silverware set\nTask: clean shower tiles\nTask: light air freshener\nTask: polish welcome mat\nTask: organize storage bins\nTask: replace hallway light\nTask: organize coat hangers\nThe task arrange throw pillow needs no resources. \nThe task clean shower tiles needs 4 cleaning product \nThe task replace hallway light needs 5 light bulb \nThe task polish silverware set needs no resources. \nThe task organize coat hangers needs 5 coat hanger \nThe task polish welcome mat needs 4 shoe polish \nThe task slice fresh vegetable needs no resources. \nThe task light air freshener needs 4 air freshener \nThe task organize storage bins needs 5 trash bag \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA dining room with 4 candle and 10 napkin. \nA bathroom with 5 cleaning product, 5 towel and 5 disinfectant. \nA bedroom with  and 5 bed linen. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 cleaning product, 0 bed linen, 0 candle, 0 napkin, 0 towel, 0 disinfectant. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: polish silverware\nTask: set dining table\nTask: organize wine rack\nTask: clean bathroom tiles\nTask: change bed linens\nTask: light scented candles\nTask: serve appetizers\nTask: replace bathroom towels\nTask: disinfect bathroom countertop\nThe task serve appetizers needs 10 napkin \nThe task disinfect bathroom countertop needs 5 disinfectant \nThe task replace bathroom towels needs 5 towel \nThe task light scented candles needs 4 candle \nThe task change bed linens needs 5 bed linen \nThe task clean bathroom tiles needs 5 cleaning product \nThe task polish silverware needs no resources. \nThe task organize wine rack needs no resources. \nThe task set dining table needs no resources. \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA bedroom with  and 4 bed linen. \nA basement with 4 light bulb and 6 cleaning supply. \nA home office with  and 5 office supply. \nA dining room with  and 8 utensil. \nA living room with  and 5 throw blanket. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 bed linen, 0 light bulb, 0 office supply, 0 utensil, 0 cleaning supply, 0 throw blanket. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: organize tool shelf\nTask: dust framed pictures\nTask: polish silverware\nTask: make bed tidy\nTask: change basement bulbs\nTask: organize office desk\nTask: set dining table\nTask: clean the basement\nTask: arrange throw blankets\nThe task make bed tidy needs 4 bed linen \nThe task arrange throw blankets needs 5 throw blanket \nThe task change basement bulbs needs 4 light bulb \nThe task organize office desk needs 5 office supply \nThe task dust framed pictures needs no resources. \nThe task polish silverware needs no resources. \nThe task clean the basement needs 6 cleaning supply \nThe task organize tool shelf needs no resources. \nThe task set dining table needs 8 utensil \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA living room with  and 4 cleaning supply. \nA home office with  and 5 office supply. \nA hallway with  and 4 shoe polish. \nA bedroom with  and 4 bed linen. \nA kitchen with 4 baking supply and 5 food item. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 cleaning supply, 0 shoe polish, 0 bed linen, 0 office supply, 0 baking supply, 0 food item. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: organize storage shelf\nTask: water indoor plant\nTask: calibrate printer settings\nTask: vacuum living room\nTask: polish hallway shoes\nTask: replace bed linens\nTask: organize filing cabinet\nTask: bake fresh bread\nTask: prepare a breakfast\nThe task calibrate printer settings needs no resources. \nThe task organize filing cabinet needs 5 office supply \nThe task prepare a breakfast needs 5 food item \nThe task vacuum living room needs 4 cleaning supply \nThe task bake fresh bread needs 4 baking supply \nThe task polish hallway shoes needs 4 shoe polish \nThe task organize storage shelf needs no resources. \nThe task water indoor plant needs no resources. \nThe task replace bed linens needs 4 bed linen \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA kitchen with  and 5 spices. \nA hallway with  and 5 light bulb. \nA basement with  and 5 storage bin. \nA home office with  and 5 office supply. \nA living room with  and 4 blanket. \nA garage with  and 5 cleaning supply. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 light bulb, 0 storage bin, 0 office supply, 0 spices, 0 blanket, 0 cleaning supply. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: polish the silverware\nTask: arrange dining chair\nTask: vacuum hallway rug\nTask: replace hallway lights\nTask: assemble storage shelves\nTask: organize office supplies\nTask: organize spice rack\nTask: arrange throw blankets\nTask: organize tool cabinet\nThe task replace hallway lights needs 5 light bulb \nThe task assemble storage shelves needs 5 storage bin \nThe task vacuum hallway rug needs no resources. \nThe task arrange throw blankets needs 4 blanket \nThe task organize office supplies needs 5 office supply \nThe task organize spice rack needs 5 spices \nThe task arrange dining chair needs no resources. \nThe task organize tool cabinet needs 5 cleaning supply \nThe task polish the silverware needs no resources. \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA home office with  and 5 storage bin. \nA hallway with  and 5 shoe polish. \nA basement with 4 light bulb and 4 safety supply. \nA dining room with  and 8 dishware. \nA bedroom with  and 5 hangers. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 light bulb, 0 storage bin, 0 safety supply, 0 dishware, 0 hangers, 0 shoe polish. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: organize file shelf\nTask: polish the mirror\nTask: replace shower curtain\nTask: replace burnt bulbs\nTask: organize supply cabinet\nTask: inspect safety supplies\nTask: set dining table\nTask: organize closet items\nTask: shine hallway shoes\nThe task polish the mirror needs no resources. \nThe task shine hallway shoes needs 5 shoe polish \nThe task replace burnt bulbs needs 4 light bulb \nThe task organize closet items needs 5 hangers \nThe task organize file shelf needs no resources. \nThe task replace shower curtain needs no resources. \nThe task organize supply cabinet needs 5 storage bin \nThe task set dining table needs 8 dishware \nThe task inspect safety supplies needs 4 safety supply \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA home office with  and 5 paper. \nA kitchen with 4 cooking oil, 5 cleaning wipe and 8 tea. \nA garage with  and 5 cleaning supply. \nA living room with  and 5 light bulb. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 cooking oil, 0 cleaning wipe, 0 tea, 0 cleaning supply, 0 light bulb, 0 paper. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: organize book shelf\nTask: wipe keyboard clean\nTask: polish wine rack\nTask: prepare salad dressing\nTask: sanitize kitchen countertops\nTask: brew tea\nTask: organize garage shelves\nTask: replace light bulbs\nTask: sort office papers\nThe task organize book shelf needs no resources. \nThe task sort office papers needs 5 paper \nThe task polish wine rack needs no resources. \nThe task sanitize kitchen countertops needs 5 cleaning wipe \nThe task brew tea needs 8 tea \nThe task organize garage shelves needs 5 cleaning supply \nThe task wipe keyboard clean needs no resources. \nThe task prepare salad dressing needs 4 cooking oil \nThe task replace light bulbs needs 5 light bulb \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA bedroom with 5 scented candle and 5 pillow. \nA bathroom with  and 4 towel. \nA kitchen with  and 5 baking supply. \nA home office with  and 4 cleaning supply. \nA basement with  and 5 storage bin. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 baking supply, 0 cleaning supply, 0 scented candle, 0 towel, 0 storage bin, 0 pillow. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: iron folded shirt\nTask: change bed sheet\nTask: clean showerhead thoroughly\nTask: bake chocolate cookies\nTask: organize office desk\nTask: light scented candles\nTask: replace bathroom towels\nTask: organize storage bins\nTask: replace pillows\nThe task replace pillows needs 5 pillow \nThe task replace bathroom towels needs 4 towel \nThe task change bed sheet needs no resources. \nThe task iron folded shirt needs no resources. \nThe task clean showerhead thoroughly needs no resources. \nThe task organize office desk needs 4 cleaning supply \nThe task light scented candles needs 5 scented candle \nThe task bake chocolate cookies needs 5 baking supply \nThe task organize storage bins needs 5 storage bin \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA bathroom with 5 cleaning product, 5 towel and 5 soap. \nA laundry room with  and 4 laundry basket. \nA hallway with  and 5 shoe polish. \nA kitchen with  and 6 baking supply. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 laundry basket, 0 cleaning product, 0 towel, 0 soap, 0 shoe polish, 0 baking supply. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: set dining table\nTask: organize jewelry box\nTask: polish mirror surface\nTask: fold fresh laundry\nTask: wash bathroom sink\nTask: organize towel display\nTask: sanitize toilet seat\nTask: polish shoe rack\nTask: bake chocolate cake\nThe task organize jewelry box needs no resources. \nThe task organize towel display needs 5 towel \nThe task polish mirror surface needs no resources. \nThe task wash bathroom sink needs 5 cleaning product \nThe task polish shoe rack needs 5 shoe polish \nThe task fold fresh laundry needs 4 laundry basket \nThe task bake chocolate cake needs 6 baking supply \nThe task sanitize toilet seat needs 5 soap \nThe task set dining table needs no resources. \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA dining room with 8 utensil and 5 decoration. \nA hallway with  and 6 cleaning supply. \nA basement with  and 5 light bulb. \nA living room with  and 4 candle. \nA bathroom with  and 6 towel. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 cleaning supply, 0 light bulb, 0 candle, 0 utensil, 0 towel, 0 decoration. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: water potted plant\nTask: arrange dining chair\nTask: organize tool bench\nTask: polish hallway floor\nTask: replace basement bulbs\nTask: light scented candles\nTask: set dining table\nTask: replace hair towels\nTask: arrange table decor\nThe task replace hair towels needs 6 towel \nThe task polish hallway floor needs 6 cleaning supply \nThe task light scented candles needs 4 candle \nThe task water potted plant needs no resources. \nThe task arrange dining chair needs no resources. \nThe task organize tool bench needs no resources. \nThe task arrange table decor needs 5 decoration \nThe task set dining table needs 8 utensil \nThe task replace basement bulbs needs 5 light bulb \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA hallway with  and 5 cleaning supply. \nA bathroom with  and 4 towel. \nA bedroom with 5 bed linen, 4 pillow and 5 scented candle. \nA basement with  and 6 storage bin. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 cleaning supply, 0 towel, 0 bed linen, 0 pillow, 0 storage bin, 0 scented candle. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: wash dinner plate\nTask: organize desk drawer\nTask: organize tool rack\nTask: clean hallway floor\nTask: organize bathroom towels\nTask: change bed linens\nTask: arrange bedroom pillows\nTask: organize storage bins\nTask: light scented candles\nThe task clean hallway floor needs 5 cleaning supply \nThe task organize desk drawer needs no resources. \nThe task organize tool rack needs no resources. \nThe task wash dinner plate needs no resources. \nThe task light scented candles needs 5 scented candle \nThe task change bed linens needs 5 bed linen \nThe task organize bathroom towels needs 4 towel \nThe task arrange bedroom pillows needs 4 pillow \nThe task organize storage bins needs 6 storage bin \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA living room with  and 4 throw blanket. \nA garage with  and 5 oil. \nA kitchen with 4 cleaning wipe and 4 food item. \nA home office with  and 5 office supply. \nA dining room with  and 8 utensil. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 cleaning wipe, 0 office supply, 0 throw blanket, 0 utensil, 0 food item, 0 oil. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: adjust window curtain\nTask: polish bathroom fixture\nTask: organize tool shelf\nTask: clean kitchen counters\nTask: reorganize file drawer\nTask: arrange throw blankets\nTask: set dining table\nTask: prepare breakfast\nTask: change car oil\nThe task clean kitchen counters needs 4 cleaning wipe \nThe task reorganize file drawer needs 5 office supply \nThe task arrange throw blankets needs 4 throw blanket \nThe task adjust window curtain needs no resources. \nThe task polish bathroom fixture needs no resources. \nThe task change car oil needs 5 oil \nThe task prepare breakfast needs 4 food item \nThe task organize tool shelf needs no resources. \nThe task set dining table needs 8 utensil \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA hallway with 5 cleaning supply and 5 light bulb. \nA laundry room with  and 5 laundry detergent. \nA living room with  and 6 candle. \nA bathroom with  and 5 towel. \nA dining room with  and 4 napkin. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 cleaning supply, 0 candle, 0 light bulb, 0 towel, 0 laundry detergent, 0 napkin. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: organize coat closet\nTask: sort laundry colors\nTask: organize tool bench\nTask: polish welcome mats\nTask: light scented candles\nTask: replace hallway bulbs\nTask: replace towel set\nTask: fold clean linens\nTask: set dinner table\nThe task organize coat closet needs no resources. \nThe task set dinner table needs 4 napkin \nThe task replace towel set needs 5 towel \nThe task light scented candles needs 6 candle \nThe task polish welcome mats needs 5 cleaning supply \nThe task organize tool bench needs no resources. \nThe task fold clean linens needs 5 laundry detergent \nThe task replace hallway bulbs needs 5 light bulb \nThe task sort laundry colors needs no resources. \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA kitchen with 7 spice and 5 cleaning wipe. \nA hallway with  and 5 light bulb. \nA dining room with  and 10 dishware. \nA basement with 6 storage bin and 4 battery. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 spice, 0 light bulb, 0 dishware, 0 storage bin, 0 battery, 0 cleaning wipe. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: sanitize toilet seat\nTask: organize tool rack\nTask: arrange desk papers\nTask: stock spice cabinet\nTask: replace hallway light\nTask: set dining table\nTask: organize storage bins\nTask: test smoke alarms\nTask: mop kitchen floor\nThe task test smoke alarms needs 4 battery \nThe task replace hallway light needs 5 light bulb \nThe task arrange desk papers needs no resources. \nThe task organize storage bins needs 6 storage bin \nThe task organize tool rack needs no resources. \nThe task stock spice cabinet needs 7 spice \nThe task mop kitchen floor needs 5 cleaning wipe \nThe task sanitize toilet seat needs no resources. \nThe task set dining table needs 10 dishware \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA bedroom with 5 bed linen and 4 hygiene product. \nA basement with  and 10 storage bin. \nA hallway with  and 5 shoe polish. \nA kitchen with  and 5 baking supply. \nA garage with  and 5 cleaning supply. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 storage bin, 0 bed linen, 0 shoe polish, 0 baking supply, 0 hygiene product, 0 cleaning supply. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: tidy up closet\nTask: scrub bathtub thoroughly\nTask: organize office books\nTask: organize storage bins\nTask: replace bed linens\nTask: polish welcome mat\nTask: bake chocolate chip cookies\nTask: organize vanity drawer\nTask: clean garage floor\nThe task tidy up closet needs no resources. \nThe task scrub bathtub thoroughly needs no resources. \nThe task clean garage floor needs 5 cleaning supply \nThe task polish welcome mat needs 5 shoe polish \nThe task replace bed linens needs 5 bed linen \nThe task organize vanity drawer needs 4 hygiene product \nThe task bake chocolate chip cookies needs 5 baking supply \nThe task organize office books needs no resources. \nThe task organize storage bins needs 10 storage bin \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA bedroom with  and 4 bed linen. \nA living room with  and 5 candle. \nA kitchen with  and 5 cleaning wipe. \nA garage with  and 6 cleaning supply. \nA basement with  and 5 light bulb. \nA laundry room with  and 5 laundry basket. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 bed linen, 0 cleaning wipe, 0 candle, 0 cleaning supply, 0 light bulb, 0 laundry basket. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: fluff pillow arrangement\nTask: arrange book display\nTask: vacuum carpet thoroughly\nTask: change bed linens\nTask: wipe down counters\nTask: light five candles\nTask: organize tool shelves\nTask: replace basement bulbs\nTask: organize laundry baskets\nThe task organize tool shelves needs 6 cleaning supply \nThe task wipe down counters needs 5 cleaning wipe \nThe task vacuum carpet thoroughly needs no resources. \nThe task arrange book display needs no resources. \nThe task change bed linens needs 4 bed linen \nThe task fluff pillow arrangement needs no resources. \nThe task organize laundry baskets needs 5 laundry basket \nThe task light five candles needs 5 candle \nThe task replace basement bulbs needs 5 light bulb \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA kitchen with 5 baking supply and 4 spice. \nA hallway with  and 5 cleaning supply. \nA dining room with 5 table decoration and 7 utensil. \nA basement with  and 5 light bulb. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 cleaning supply, 0 table decoration, 0 baking supply, 0 light bulb, 0 utensil, 0 spice. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: wash kitchen utensils\nTask: organize desk drawer\nTask: polish hallway mirror\nTask: clean hallway floor\nTask: arrange table decorations\nTask: bake fresh cookies\nTask: replace light bulbs\nTask: set dining table\nTask: organize spice rack\nThe task clean hallway floor needs 5 cleaning supply \nThe task organize desk drawer needs no resources. \nThe task polish hallway mirror needs no resources. \nThe task organize spice rack needs 4 spice \nThe task wash kitchen utensils needs no resources. \nThe task bake fresh cookies needs 5 baking supply \nThe task replace light bulbs needs 5 light bulb \nThe task arrange table decorations needs 5 table decoration \nThe task set dining table needs 7 utensil \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA home office with  and 5 office supply. \nA bedroom with  and 5 bed linen. \nA kitchen with  and 4 cleaning wipe. \nA dining room with  and 8 dishware. \nA laundry room with  and 5 lint roller. \nA garage with  and 5 cleaning supply. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 dishware, 0 lint roller, 0 cleaning wipe, 0 office supply, 0 bed linen, 0 cleaning supply. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: organize filing cabinet\nTask: fluff the pillows\nTask: polish wooden counter\nTask: set dining table\nTask: empty dryer lint\nTask: clean kitchen counter\nTask: organize desk drawer\nTask: replace bedding set\nTask: tidy garage shelves\nThe task organize filing cabinet needs no resources. \nThe task organize desk drawer needs 5 office supply \nThe task tidy garage shelves needs 5 cleaning supply \nThe task replace bedding set needs 5 bed linen \nThe task clean kitchen counter needs 4 cleaning wipe \nThe task fluff the pillows needs no resources. \nThe task polish wooden counter needs no resources. \nThe task set dining table needs 8 dishware \nThe task empty dryer lint needs 5 lint roller \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA hallway with 4 light bulb and 5 welcome mat. \nA garage with  and 5 spare part. \nA living room with  and 5 cleaning supply. \nA home office with 5 paper and 5 notebook. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 cleaning supply, 0 paper, 0 light bulb, 0 notebook, 0 spare part, 0 welcome mat. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: wipe bathroom mirror\nTask: vacuum hallway rug\nTask: organize tool shelf\nTask: clean coffee table\nTask: scan documents\nTask: change hallway bulbs\nTask: organize office supplies\nTask: repair garage door\nTask: place welcome mats\nThe task change hallway bulbs needs 4 light bulb \nThe task repair garage door needs 5 spare part \nThe task place welcome mats needs 5 welcome mat \nThe task vacuum hallway rug needs no resources. \nThe task scan documents needs 5 paper \nThe task organize office supplies needs 5 notebook \nThe task clean coffee table needs 5 cleaning supply \nThe task organize tool shelf needs no resources. \nThe task wipe bathroom mirror needs no resources. \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",

        "prompt": "Hello! You are a butler in a home that has many rooms and a storage that acts as a pantry. You goal is to finish the tasks I will give you. Beware! These tasks require resources and may even deplete resources. You can use the storage to refill them! If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store! \nYou are standing in the start. The home has: \nA bedroom with  and 4 scented candle. \nA garage with  and 5 cleaning supply. \nA basement with  and 10 storage bin. \nA kitchen with  and 4 coffee/tea. \nA dining room with 4 dishware and 4 tablecloth. \nYour home's storage has: \n0 scented candle, 0 cleaning supply, 0 storage bin, 0 coffee/tea, 0 dishware, 0 tablecloth. \n\n Your tasks are: \nTask: vacuum hallway carpet\nTask: organize filing cabinet\nTask: change bed linen\nTask: light 4 candles\nTask: organize tool shelf\nTask: label storage bins\nTask: brew morning coffee\nTask: set dining table\nTask: place tablecloths\nThe task organize filing cabinet needs no resources. \nThe task change bed linen needs no resources. \nThe task vacuum hallway carpet needs no resources. \nThe task place tablecloths needs 4 tablecloth \nThe task light 4 candles needs 4 scented candle \nThe task brew morning coffee needs 4 coffee/tea \nThe task organize tool shelf needs 5 cleaning supply \nThe task label storage bins needs 10 storage bin \nThe task set dining table needs 4 dishware \n\n These tasks are given in a random order.Your job is to rearrange these tasks in the correct order. You can also add go to, buy, and refill commands.\n Be careful about the given resource contraints and where you are. \n You can add refill, buy, and go to commands at a cost. \nFor example, the costs of buying one item are proportional to real world costs.\n\n You can buy items from the store to restock your storage by saying: \"buy <amount> <item>\" You must be in the store to buy items. For example: 'buy 3 water.' and you must 'go to store.' beforehand \nYou can refill any room with items in your storage by saying: \"refill <room_name> with <amount> <item>\" You must be in the storage to refill items. For example: 'refill kitchen with 7 toothpaste.' and you must 'go to storage.' beforehand\nYou can go to a room by saying \"go to <room_name>\". For example: 'go to store'.\nIf a room doesn't have enough resources, you can refill from the storage. If even the storage doesn't have enough resources, you can buy from the store. \nRemember to not edit the tasks with anything. Example: \"brush teeth\" remains as \"brush teeth\" with no other descriptions in the final list.\nLastly, format your final list of tasks as a python list. For example: [\"go to store\", \"buy 3 toothpaste\"]. Your list's tasks will then be executed by an executor one by one.\nSince, the executor only recognizes tasks, the list you return must be a list of just atomic tasks. Like \"go to store\". or \"polish glass\". Do not add any steps or thinking in your answer or the executor will break.\nReason through each step of the plan before proceeding. Explain your thought process for the correct order of actions.",
